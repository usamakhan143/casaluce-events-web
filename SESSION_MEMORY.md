## Recent Fixes Applied (Current Session)

### Pricing & Packages Section Fixes:
1. **Content Overflow Issue**:
   - Problem: Content was overflowing from rounded columns
   - Solution: Increased container height from `h-96` to `h-[500px]`, reduced text sizes and padding

2. **Image Placement Issue**:
   - Problem: Premium package image was in wrong position
   - Solution: Moved image from Premium package column to between "Flexible Adjustments" and "Transparent Pricing Philosophy" columns

3. **Section Width Issue**:
   - Problem: Section was full-width (not matching Figma)
   - Solution: Changed container from `container mx-auto` to `max-w-6xl mx-auto`

4. **Image Column Styling**:
   - Problem: Image was circular and smaller than other columns
   - Solution: Made image column match other columns' size with proper square container styling

### Latest Updates - Figma-Perfect Implementation:

5. **"Getting to Your Personalized Quote:" Section Redesign**:
   - **Problem**: Section layout didn't match Figma design pixel-perfectly
   - **Solution**: Complete restructuring to match Figma exactly:
     - **First Row**: 3 tall boxes (h-80) for "Initial Consultation", "Understanding Your Needs", "Customized Proposal"
     - **Second Row**: 2 shorter boxes (h-72) with large image in center for "Flexible Adjustments", Premium Image, "Transparent Pricing Philosophy"
     - **Typography**: Added proper line breaks in headings, adjusted font weights and spacing
     - **Layout**: Used flexbox with `max-w-xs` containers for consistent sizing
     - **Image**: Enlarged to `w-80 h-72` with proper rounded corners

6. **Box Transparency Enhancement**:
   - **Problem**: User requested transparent backgrounds for all quote boxes
   - **Solution**: Changed all boxes from `bg-white` to `bg-transparent` while maintaining borders and content styling
